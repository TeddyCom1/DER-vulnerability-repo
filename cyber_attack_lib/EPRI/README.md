# EPRI Architecture Simulations

This Repository Contains all the simulations completed as a part of the EPRI Architecture: [here](./EPRI-Security-Architecture-for-the-Distributed-Energy-Resources-Integration-Network.pdf)

Within this simulations only the unknown vulnerabilities were simualted as a part of this reference architecture, since, a more standardised reference architecture was presented

## NOTE:

The simulations marked:
- False Data Injection Test
- False Data Injection Test 2

Are not completed since they require HIL integration before they can be run (Which is not completed at this current time)

The other simulations should be available to be run straight from download by following the instructions contained the the main repo's readme file.
