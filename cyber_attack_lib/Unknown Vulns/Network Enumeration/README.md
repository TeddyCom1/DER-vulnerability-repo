# About Network Enumeration

Since the DER Network has multiple different components connected from different areas
within a network, an attacker with already established access through other vulnerabilities,
can use Network Enumeration to map the DER network looking for additional
vulnerabilities in the computers or systems surrounding it. Network enumeration can allow
attackers to also look for additional attack vectors to jump to achieve their end goal. Within
the DER network this is quite a serious issue, since each device is highly critical in
maintaining grid stability or hold highly critical data which should not be accessed for
example if the DSO or the AEMO were to be accessed by the attacker they could provide
large quantities of information regarding power requirements and set limits which then
possibly could be changed and adjusted maliciously.
Within a well-established network, it should be very hard for an attacker to perform
Network Enumeration since, protocols such as ICMP and SNMP should be disabled.
Additionally with infrastructure patterns such as network segmentation, a compromised
computer should only be able to see what is in its network segment, rather than the entire
network. 

# How to Simulate

In order to simulate these vulnerabilities you should integrate a VM into EXata CPS using HIL.

1. Copy the Control Simulation File to network enumeration

(For Cooperate Vlan)
2. THE HIL VM device should be configured and mapped to device 6 from the Control Simulation no DNS file.

(For DER device)
2. The HIL VM device should be configured using any one of the DER devices at the bottom (Devices 7,8,9,15,19)

3. Once the VM device has been verified to be working and the simulation is successfully mapped we can use NMAP in order to perform network enumeration:

# Network Enumeration using NMAP

For Host Discovery use:

{
    nmap -sn <target>
}
