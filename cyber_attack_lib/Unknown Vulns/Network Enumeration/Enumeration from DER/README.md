# Enumeration from DER device

Since the DER device is situated in an unknown network, with potentially physical access
from malicious third parties we must assume that at least one of the devices could be used
for network discovery from that device. With communication allowed to the DERMS,
aggregator, HEMS, and OEMâ€™s we can see that network enumeration from the DER
devices might uncover a large portion of the critical infrastructure network, potentially
allowing malicious third parties new attack vectors into the network.
