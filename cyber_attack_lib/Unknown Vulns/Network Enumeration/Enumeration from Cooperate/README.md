# Enumeration from Cooperate Network 

Since people on this network will have access to device within the DER network for purposes of
logging and configuration. However, if a malicious third party can gain access to the cooperate
network through other means like, brute force attacks, data breaches leaked passwords or through
phishing attacks, they will be able to use network enumeration to build a map of the infrastructure
surrounding them, maximising the systems which they could attack next and which systems might
be vulnerable to an attack.
