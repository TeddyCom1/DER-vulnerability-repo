# About System Misconfigurations
System Misconfiguration is generally due to user error particularly when setting up or
configuring a device which could lead to unknown vulnerabilities within the architecture or
system errors. Particularly when changes are not documented there is untested system
configuration which can lead to widespread outages. Particularly while configuring
external ports and boundary devices, user system misconfiguration could leave open ports,
devices and APIâ€™s which could be accessed by malicious third parties looking for entry
points into the system.
