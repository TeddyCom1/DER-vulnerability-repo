# Compromised Energy Market Operators 

With a compromise of the Energy Market Operators bids, dispatch requirements, aggregator
registrations have the potential to be compromised. With a large amount of impact if that third party
is compromised, we might see widespread outages across the network. With this third party in
charge of device registration and power requirements if it is compromised, we could see
widespread grid instability due to the criticality of the data being sent form the third party and the
vast impact of devices which rely on the correct information from the third party.
