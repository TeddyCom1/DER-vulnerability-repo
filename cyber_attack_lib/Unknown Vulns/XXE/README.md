# About XXE attacks

An XML External Entity exploits the way the XML input is parsed through poorly coded
XML parsers. The XML input contains a reference to an external entity which then the
parser makes a request to for extra information (XML External Entity (XXE) Processing |
OWASP Foundation, n.d.). This Extra information could be extra malicious code used to
exploit vulnerabilities in the system, or it could be used to extract confidential information
regarding the system, or even achieving remote code execution.
Within the communication between the DER devices and the DERMS XML documents are
sent wrapped in IEEE 2030.4 packets to the monitoring Device. Since a user has full access
to the hardware of the DER devices themselves, a user can use hardware hacking techniques
in order to gain full privileged access into a fully registered and communicating device. Due
to this reason, a malicious entity is then able to change, modify and send malicious XML
documents to areas in the Network which previously were seen to be “secure” from those
attack. An attacker can then send XML documents containing reference to an external entity
which is then processed by a weakly configured XML parser, causing it to make requests to
malicious devices sometimes causing it to download code or even read files and send it back
to the user.
Within the DER network we are dealing with highly critical information since we have,
power requirements, DOE limits, marketplace bids etc. Since we are dealing with such
highly critical information, a XXE vulnerability into systems and devices can be devastating,
causing leaks of information, configuration and even full access to critical systems which are
used to monitor and keep the energy grid operational.
