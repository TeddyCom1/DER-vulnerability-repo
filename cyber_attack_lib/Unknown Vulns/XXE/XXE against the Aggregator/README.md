# XXE against the Aggregator 

Like the communication between the DER devices and the DERMS, the communication between
the DER devices and Aggregator is also configured to be over IEEE 2030.4 with XML documents
being sent and received. Therefore, since this is the case, we can also have XXE attacks between
these devices through the same means as described previously.
