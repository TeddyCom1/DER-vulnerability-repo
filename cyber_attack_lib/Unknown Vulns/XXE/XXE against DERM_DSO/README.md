# XXE Against Te DERMS

Since the DERMS communicates to the DER devices through IEEE 2030.4 with XML documents,
we have a clear way for a malicious client to do an XXE attack leading to possible RCE and data
leaks. This attack occurs when the server (The DERMS) has a weak open XML parser for all the
information being sent between the DER Devices to the Server. A Malicious third party is then able
to hijack this communication through other means and the sent files injecting malicious code to
perform an information disclosure attack or even RCE.
