# About Open API Access

Within each Network there are systems which offer API access to register devices, collect
information about systems or even configure devices themselves. Usually, to use an API
you must be an authenticated user for that system, usually accessing the device using a onetime password (OTP) or other tokenised authentication method. Within larger networks
however it can be hard to know which system has API access and which does not. Over
time as an infrastructure gets very large particularly with minimal documentation, it can be
hard to figure out which device has API access to what kind of information and may
become forgotten. A case of this is the Optus 2022 Hack in which they left an API open to
the internet which allowed malicious third parties to use that API to generate a key to gain
access to larger systems and more confidential information in a privilege escalation
(Alspach, 2022).

Since the DER network is quite large, having many systems, devices and parties potentially having
and API or API access that could be exposed or used by workers and third parties it can be quite
hard to protect. If the DER system is not documented accurately, it could lead to a device being left
unchecked with an open API which allows users to get confidential information regarding system
configuration, energy requirements or even change configuration causing grid instability or even
grid failure in some cases. 

# Hope to Simulate

For this simulation to run HIL devices need to be configured

Set up 2 VM machines and run the included python scripts in them

1. Configure the DSO/DERMS to be the Open API

2. Configure one of the DER devices to make the request to the Open API

3. Make sure to point the Request making script to the address of the Open API

4. Run the simulatation

5. While the Simulation is running start the API and start the request making script

6. If the network is configured correctly and the API is open you should see values traveling from the Open API to the request making script
