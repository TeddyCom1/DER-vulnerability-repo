# Exposed Certificate Authentication API 

By Exposing an API responsible to authentication across the devices in a network, leaves the
possibility for attacks to use that API to register their own devices, create their own login
credentials and authentication codes which could then allow them to connect to whatever devices
they want and obtain whatever information they desire. Particularly when exposing a certificate
authentication API, attackers will be able to register their own devices allowing them to connect to
DER management devices, obtaining power requirements and system configurations for the entire
DER network.
