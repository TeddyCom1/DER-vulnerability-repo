# DSO Exposed API 

By Exposing the DSO API an attacker might be able to get information about power system
requirements, system status,â€™ operating envelopes and potentially even change operating envelopes
and system configuration when communicating to the DER devices. By obtaining information and
potentially changing highly critical information in operating envelopes, power requirements and
system configuration, malicious third parties may be able to figure out how to cause grid instability
through other means within the network through potentially other vulnerabilities. By Changing
values within the DSO through the API we will be able to adjust the power grid enough in order to
create additional grid instability and potentially damage another operating devise around.
