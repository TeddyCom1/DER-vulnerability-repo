# About Supply Chain Compromise

Within the DER architecture there are many external entities; Transmission Network Service
Providers (TNSP), Distribution Network Service Providers (DNSP), Advanced Metering
Infrastructure (AMI) providers, the DER devices, Aggregators, Original Equipment Manufacturers
(OEM)â€™s, home energy Management Systems (HEMS), Distribution System Operators, Energy
Market Operators and Retail energy Providers. Since this system are external entities, we have no
say over their cyber security posture or implementing their security in any way. Thus, this can lead
to these external entities having their own each individual cyber-attacks, which could leave this
DER network vulnerable to attacks. A well-established infrastructure should be contained enough
so that if one of these external entities does become compromised due to a cyber-attack, the
resulting energy grid has minimal chance to becoming compromised as a result.
