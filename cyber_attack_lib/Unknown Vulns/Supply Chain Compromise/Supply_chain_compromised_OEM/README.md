# Compromised OEM's

With an External Entity Compromise on the OEMâ€™s (producers of DER devices) who, have
the capability to change, update, and modify the code base of each of the DER devices
which they oversee. With the power to change the configuration of devices, we see that if
the OEM was compromised it could lead to massive amounts of false data being sent to the
DERMS, or potentially malware/ransomware spreading to other devices within the
network.
