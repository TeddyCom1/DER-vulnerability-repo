# Compromised Energy Market Operators 

With a compromise of the Energy Market Operators bids, dispatch requirements, aggregator
registrations have the potential to be compromised. With a large amount of impact if that third party
is compromised, we might see widespread outages across the network. With this third party in
charge of device registration and power requirements if it is compromised, we could see
widespread grid instability due to the criticality of the data being sent form the third party and the
vast impact of devices which rely on the correct information from the third party. 

# How to simulate

With this vulnerability you want to simulate the flow on effect of how third party appications can change values later on.

with this vulnerability we want to establish 2 VM's these being:

1. to represent the DERMS/DSO or device which has received the modified values from the compromsied 3rd party
2. to represent the DER device or the device targeted by the value change

To run these place the 2 python scripts included in each of the VM's and point the DER device's python script to the DSO to establish the connection

Hopefully we should see values coming through initially, and then changed values after simulating the 3rd party compromise.
