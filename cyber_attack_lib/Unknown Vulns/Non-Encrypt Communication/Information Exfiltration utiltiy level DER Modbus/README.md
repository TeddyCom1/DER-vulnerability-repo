# Information Exfiltration within Utility Level DER using Modbus 

With the usage of older legacy devices, we see that the unsecure Modbus could be used to
communicate between devices in the utility level DERs. This older legacy communication
protocol supports 3 version, Modbus, Modbus TCP, and Secure Modbus; however, it must
be noted that only specific venders support Secure Modbus to the extra complex
requirements. Therefore, when focusing on the Legacy communication between these older
devices, we see that they could also be transmitting high criticality information to other
systems which could be changes or read by anyone on the network.
