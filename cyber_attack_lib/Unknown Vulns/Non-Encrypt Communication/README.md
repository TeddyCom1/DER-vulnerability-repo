# About Non-Encrypt Communications

With an increase in the criticality, importance, and privacy of the data that we are sending
throughout networks, encryption for these communications has become a must to protect against
unauthorized personal capturing, reading, and using the information for malicious gain. Due to the
sensitivity of the data being sent between devices throughout the DER Network, we must assume a
high level of encryption must take place since the data being sent over the network is of high
criticality and might contain data which could be used for malicious particularly when used in
conjunction with other vulnerability techniques.
However according to the DNP3 specification DNP3 and DNP3 â€“ SA does not encrypt the data
sent between devices, rather opting for increased integrity check to make sure that the data has not
been tampered with during communication (Rosborough et al., n.d.). Though this does allow for
ease of exchange and access of information through the network, it also poses a security risk
particularly with the high criticality of data being sent. Since the data being sent across the network
is completely unencrypted a malicious third party or an insider will be able to access all the
information being sent between the devices, allowing them to create a map of what these devices
are communicating. Particularly for the DER network, due to the criticality of the data being sent, a
malicious third party being able to snoop on the connections between the SCADA and the DSO,
will allow an attacker to create a map of the current power capacity of the network, DSO power
limits, and all other kinds of communication being sent between those two devices. Creating this
map may additionally leave other areas of the network vulnerable to other kinds of attacks, such as
false data injections.
