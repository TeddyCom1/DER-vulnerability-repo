# Information Exfiltration DSO to SCADA using DNP3 

If the implementation of the SCADA to DSO communications over DNP3 are not enabled
to have encryption with a TLS wrapper as recommended by the DNP3 specification, then
we have unencrypted communication flowing over a WAN network. With anybody on the
networking being able to read the data that is being sent through. Additionally, if DNP3-SA
is not used this communication can then be read and modified by an Attacker to give false
power targets in a false data injection attack on the DSO.
