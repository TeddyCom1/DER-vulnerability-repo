# DNS Vulnerabilities

Domain Name Space (DNS) spoofing is an attack which alters a DNS record to redirect traffic to a
fraudulent website or IP which is intended to resemble the destination. Once a user is there, it can
be prompted to enter access credentials or transmit sensitive information. Additionally, the
malicious system can also download malware/viruses which can be installed on the device for
longer term access.
In a DNS spoofing attack could occur in the DER architecture in the communication between the
DERMS and each of the DER devices. Since the DERMS IP should be resolved through a DNS
server, when the DER devices are connecting back to the DERMS through an untrusted network, a
malicious threat actor could act as a Man in the Middle (MITM) intercepting the communication
between the DER devices and DNS server, modifying it and routing to a malicious IP.
Additionally, an attacker attacking this architecture could compromise the DNS server itself
configuring it to return a malicious IP address rather than the proper IP.
