# DoS Attack on DNS Server

With DNS resolution being integral in getting the IP address for the DER devices to
communicate with the DERMS. Since this DNS server is quite integral in informing the
DER devices on how and where to connect in order to establish communication between
the DERMS and DER devices themselves, if we perform a DOS attack on the DNS server
itself then we can break some newer DER devices trying to establish communication
between the DERMS and DER devices. Since this DOS attack will generally only break
communication between DER devices that are trying to resolve an IP to connect to the
DERMS, it is unlikely to cause large grid outages, however, since we are disrupting critical
communication between DER devices and controllers, there is a possibility that it could
cause grid instability and reduced response times in dealing with grid instability.
