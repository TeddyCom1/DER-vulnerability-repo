# About

With the communication of critical information being sent from DER devices to the DERMS over
the open internet, a man in the middle attack such as a false data injection or any injection attack
can be a goal for many hacking groups across the world to disrupt existing infrastructure. Since
encryption is not enabled by default for DNP3, with only later versions being supported as
encryption ready (not by default) an attacker is able to read, modify and change and modify these
communications on the fly, by intercepting the traffic modifying and sending the modified
information over to the DERMS.
