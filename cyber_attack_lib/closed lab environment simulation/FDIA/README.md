False data injection attacks (FDIA) occur when the communication between devices have
been compromised, allowing a third party (attacker) unfettered access in changing, adjusting
data in transmission. If done successfully FDIA generally will remain undetected by cyber
protective systems allowing the attacker to change values, measurements, and averages
overtime into false values, potentially causing errors in computation.
False data injection attacks are particularly prevalent in the DER architecture since each
DER device (smart meters, smart inverters generally) will be placed in a foreign untrusted
network, allowing for communication to possibly be monitored and potentially be changed
by external entities without controllers figuring out that the data has been tampered with.
Generally, when attacking the DER architecture FDIA can be categorised in two main types,
these being (Lin et al., 2012):
1. Energy-supply Deceiving attack
2. Energy-request Deceiving attacks
Each of these attacks, attacking the communication between the DERMS (DER
management system) and each DER device. These attacks, focus on changing the power
values being sent between these devices, which, are used in calculations to determine
power level, power flow and build a more accurate representation of the network (Deng et
al., 2019). By Changing these values slowly over time an attacker can change expected
values in cyber protective systems and power calculations, establishing a false baseline
which is more likely to cause grid instability.

Though there are a number of power protection currently researched in the DER architecture to
protect against false data injection attack these being; State Estimation and Bad Data detection
methods (Y. Liu et al., 2011) (Liang et al., 2017). Both these methods rely on averages and
expected values within a specific threshold in order to alert if values have been changed expectedly
or unexpectedly. By monitoring the transmission of DER devices within the foreign untrusted
network, attackers might be able to establish their own baseline of what these DER devices are
transmitting and changing the values within the threshold values, slowly changing the baseline,
eventually causing grid instability.
