# DOS Attack on Firewall

With the firewall being the most external facing piece of infrastructure in the EPRI
architecture, naturally it will be the first point of contact when connecting to the DERMS
filtering out all the IPâ€™s that are not supposed to send information and forwarding those that
are to the DMZ devices and to their relevant locations. A DOS attack on the external facing
firewall causing it to shutdown will limit or may even shut down the communications
between the DER devices and the DERMS. Thus, having the potential to cause grid outages
and power failure.
