# DOS attack on DMZ device

In order to enable communication between the DER devices and the DERMS itself,
communications in this architecture have been collated via proxies in a DMZ. These proxies, then
forward communication and information send by the DER devices themselves over to the
DERMS. However, this causes quite a large bottle neck for information being received, processed,
and forwarded to the right location. Thus, a situation like this can lead to a DOS attack, where we
target the proxies in the DMZ limiting the amount of information it can process, leading a
significant reduction in accurate critical information being sent to the DERMS, and thus limiting
the energy grids capability to adjust real time to other events which may occur in the grid.
Since DER devices are in commonly accessible locations, we can see that modifying or tampering
the controllers on the DER devices themselves might be possible through additionally other
vulnerabilities or hardware hacking. This would then allow an attacker to forward or send
whatever packeted data pass the external firewall to the proxies in the DMZ, allowing a malicious
actor opportunity for a DOS attack against these internal devices and rate limiting critical
communications.
