# DoS on DERMS device with Registered Devices 


Assuming that DMZ devices and firewalls are overprovisioned with resources, a DOS attack
can still occur on the DERMS itself. If under provisioned with resources and not properly
protected with rate limits a malicious threat actor can DOS the DERMS itself causing outage
and unmanaged DER devices which could intern cause wider outages.
