# Phishing attack on corporate vlan 

A person in the corporate vlan with control over a part of the DER system has received an
unexpected urgent email from his boss but really, it is just a phishing email. He unknowingly
clicks a link which provides the attacker access to his computer, login credentials and access
details for the DER architecture. The attacker is then able to modify and change the firewall rules
of the systems to allow RDP/SSH access to the DERMS, allowing the attacker full control into the
management system.
