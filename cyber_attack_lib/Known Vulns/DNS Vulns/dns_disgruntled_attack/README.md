# Disgruntled Employee

A disgruntled employee with access and permission to change production DNS server IPs
has changed the resolving IP for the DERMS to an external IP, forwarding all newly
connecting DER devices to a false DERMS device. This allows the malicious threat actor
to gain all the data associated with the DER devices as well as any new device which is
being registered.
