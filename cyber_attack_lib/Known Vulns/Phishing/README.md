# Phishing Attacks

Phishing Attacks are malicious attacks targeting humans generally with elevated
permissions in the hope to steal their credentials to gain elevated permission in an
architecture or business. When performing a Phishing attack, a malicious actor will contact
someone through email, texting, or social media in the hope that they will generally click a
link and enter credentials that will allow them to have access into a privileged area. A
Successful Phishing attack allows an attacker full privileged access into secure system,
which they generally would not have access to. The attacker can then use their new found
privileged access to perform malicious activities in the network.
Due to the criticality of the power grid, the DER architecture will always be a target for
phishing attacks within this architecture. Malicious third parties will generally target those
who have access to critical systems within the architecture such as those controlling the
DERMS, SCADA and cyber protective systems. By targeting people controlling these
systems within a network, if a malicious actor can social engineer the people managing
these systems, they would be able to control a significate portion of the power grid and
DER systems configured to talk to a DERMS. If a phishing attack is successful within the
DER system it could cause wide spread outages, and power grid destabilization.
Additionally, due to the number of legacy systems still present in the current power system,
if an attacker can get on the same network as those critical devices, they will be able to
communicate and change configurations maliciously causing many systems to potentially
error and turn off.
