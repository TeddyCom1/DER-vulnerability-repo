# DoS Attacks

Denial of Service attacks occur when the communication between devices is interrupted due to
some unexpected malicious attack. When done successfully a DoS/DDoS attack successfully
disrupts actual connections between already connected and connecting devices. Though DoS
attacks may not be able to change data values or even read sensitive data, the main severity of DoS
attacks come from their simplicity to perform. May it be from Syn Flooding, Jamming, or cutting
communication channels (S. Liu et al., 2013), DoS attacks have the power to significantly
destabilize systems causing loss of business, power, and critical data communications.
DoS attacks are significantly prevalent in the DER architecture, since each DER device can be
placed in an untrusted network, allowing for an attacker to simply “cut” the network connection to
that device to stop all communication between device and management system. Though one
system might not be too hard to manage against, a more severe outcome would be if an attacker
were to attack a DERMS or take out many smaller DER devices at the same time, performing a
distributed denial of service attack.

By taking out many systems and communication channels between the DERMS and DER devices,
we significantly reduce the amount of data the DERMS is receiving causing it to possibly make
decisions which could lead to the detriment of grid stability instead of stabilizing it. Without
information transmission between these devices, micro grids will degrade significantly, since each
DER device will not know how much power to output, what the current state of the grid is, and
how much power it should be using.

Additionally, if a large-scale attack DoS were to be performed against a DERMS system, a similar
outcome to what was described above would likely occur.
