# Cyber CRC DER Known and Unknwon Vulnerability Simulations

## What is this Repository

This Repository Contains all the EXata CPS Simulation for each of the known and unknown Vulnerabilities, which, were completed as a part my Thesis

Though Not Containing all found unknown and known vulnerabilities it does contain information on how to simulate all vulnerabilities once HIL has been completed in EXata CPS.

This Repository was created by Calvin Long as a final deliverable to Cyber CRC and UNSW CSE.

## How to Use this Repository

- [ ] Clone the Repository
- [ ] Go to the folder called cyber_attack_lib (this contains all the simulations completed on EXata CPS)
- [ ] For the Files containing  *.config files, these simulations have been completed and can be loaded on EXata CPS right from the beginning
- [ ] For the Files Not Containin *.config files, and containing README.md files please follow the instructions on what the vulnerability is ment to be and how to run it.

## How to use this Files with EXata CPS

1. Each of the Simulation Folders if containing EXata CPS files should contain a *.config file which can be loaded onto EXata to run the simulation
    1. To do this Open File:

2. For some of the Folder which do not contain these files, a reference architecture should be copied on EXata before usage.
